# FSAE-Tyre-Analysis
Python code to analyze the data provided by the TTC

I will specify where to put the raw and excel manipulated data, but this repository will not include the data. TTC data is exclusive to the Universities and affiliate who pay to have access to the data.

I will not committ any changest to this repository that in any way show data or its results. 

# Some useful documentation 
* Race Car Vehicle Dynamics Milliken Milliken (highly suggest this book)
* https://www.researchgate.net/publication/315542611_Analysis_of_a_Formula_SAE_Vehicle_Suspension_Chassis_Tuning
* https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/9/24/5328

# Before running any code, I suggest doing some file organization

1) Create a folder for your project, I named mine TTC Analysis
2) Create two folders inside of your main folder
  * documentation - Use documentation to store any of my suggested documentation or anything you find helpful along the way
  * program files - Place the python folder inside of here
3) Inside of program files, create a folder called data
